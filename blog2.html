        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Hospital resource management is an integral part of healthcare delivery, especially when it comes to emergency services. Efficient resource allocation ensures that patients receive the care they need without unnecessary delays. This blog delves into how technology is transforming the way hospitals manage their resources, particularly in terms of ICU beds, oxygen supplies, and other critical services.</p>

        <h2>The Evolution of Resource Management</h2>
        <p>Traditionally, hospitals managed resources manually or with basic computer systems that did not communicate well across departments. This often led to inefficiencies, such as overbooking ICU beds or running low on supplies like oxygen. However, modern healthcare management systems use integrated platforms to monitor resource allocation in real-time.</p>

        <h2>Cloud-Based Platforms and Automation</h2>
        <p>One of the key advancements is the shift to cloud-based hospital management systems. These systems allow hospitals to automate much of their resource tracking, such as bed occupancy, oxygen levels, and ventilator availability. Automated alerts ensure that hospitals never run out of critical supplies and can manage patient loads more effectively.</p>

        <h2>Patient Benefits</h2>
        <p>For patients, the main benefit is timely care. With better resource management, hospitals can minimize wait times for critical services and ensure that patients receive immediate attention during emergencies. Additionally, patients can track resource availability from their homes or on-the-go, making the entire experience more streamlined and less stressful.</p>
