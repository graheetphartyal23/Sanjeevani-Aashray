        <h2><br>Overview</h2>
        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed many vulnerabilities in healthcare systems worldwide, particularly regarding the availability of emergency medical services. ICU beds, ventilators, and oxygen supplies were in critical demand, and hospitals often struggled to meet the surge in patient numbers. This blog looks at the lessons learned during the pandemic and how hospitals are preparing for future crises.</p>

        <h2>Overwhelmed Healthcare Systems</h2>
        <p>At the height of the pandemic, hospitals around the world were overwhelmed by the number of COVID-19 patients needing critical care. ICU beds and ventilators were in short supply, and many hospitals were unable to provide the necessary care to all patients. The crisis highlighted the importance of having robust systems in place to manage resource availability during emergencies.</p>

        <h2>The Role of Technology in Crisis Management</h2>
        <p>During the pandemic, many hospitals adopted digital platforms to manage the demand for critical care services. These platforms allowed hospitals to track ICU and ventilator availability in real-time, helping them allocate resources more efficiently. Patients were also able to check availability online, reducing the need for in-person visits or phone inquiries.</p>

        <h2>Building Resilience for the Future</h2>
        <p>The pandemic has accelerated the adoption of technology in healthcare, with many hospitals continuing to use the systems put in place during the crisis. The lessons learned during COVID-19 have led to better preparedness for future emergencies, ensuring that patients can access the services they need more quickly and efficiently.</p>
