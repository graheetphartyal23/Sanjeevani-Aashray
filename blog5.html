        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Patients today have more control over their healthcare choices than ever before, thanks to the growing role of digital technology. From booking appointments to accessing real-time information about critical medical services, patients can take a more active role in managing their health. This blog discusses how healthcare technology is empowering patients and why itâ€™s important for the future of healthcare.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Digital platforms are shifting the balance of power in favor of patients.</p>

        <h2>Shifting the Balance of Power</h2>
        <p>In traditional healthcare systems, patients had very little control over the care they received. They were dependent on doctors, hospitals, and insurance companies to provide them with information and services. But with the rise of digital platforms, patients can now access a wealth of information and make decisions based on real-time data.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Patients can now book emergency services online without the need to contact hospitals directly.</p>

        <h2>Booking Emergency Services Online</h2>
        <p>One of the key ways technology is empowering patients is by allowing them to book emergency services like ICU beds, ventilators, or ambulances directly through online platforms. Patients no longer have to wait for hospital staff to update them or scramble for information during an emergency. They can simply log in, check availability, and book the services they need.</p>

        <p class="image-caption">Technology helps patients make more informed healthcare decisions.</p>

        <h2>Making Informed Healthcare Decisions</h2>
        <p>Technology is also helping patients make better healthcare decisions. With access to online reviews, hospital performance data, and real-time resource availability, patients can choose the hospitals or services that best meet their needs. This increased transparency fosters trust between patients and healthcare providers and leads to better health outcomes.</p>
